// expression : unit of code that results in a value.
// expression returns a value.
// statement does not return a value. If is a statement.
// if we create a function like var a = function() then the function is called anonymous and here the 
// function statement is an expression since it is returning an function object.
// non-anonymous function declaration is a statement.
// anonymous functions are not hoisted.
// functions can be passed to functions and this is called functional programming.
